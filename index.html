<div class="hide" id="about"><span id="sectionheader"><b>About Me</b></span><br />
	With a degree in Liberal Arts, but mostly doing coursework in Urban Planning, I started working for a non-profit that works to reduce traffic congestion by promoting carpooling. There I learned some project management, marketing and analytics skills. I was always looking for ways to automate things and make processes work more smoothly. I also realized that I really liked having a hand in creating digital products.<br />
	<b>Why am I making a career switch?</b><br />
	A few years ago I was working with a software company we had contracted with to update the database that we used to match carpoolers. It was then that I realized that I really liked creating a new, groundbreaking product. When I moved to Chicago, I was able to do some professional development to help me make a career switch.<br />
	<b>What am I interested in?</b><br />
	I'm intersted in big data and finding ways to drive growth theough the use of analytics. I'm working on learning the skills that would be helpful as a Growth Hacker or a Marketing Data Scientist.
