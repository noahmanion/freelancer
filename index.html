<div class="hide" id="about"><span id="sectionheader"><b>About Me</b></span><br />With a degree in Liberal Arts, but mostly doing coursework in Urban Planning, I started working for a non-profit that works to reduce traffic congestion by promoting carpooling. There I learned some project management, marketing and analytics skills. I was always looking for ways to automate things and make processes work more smoothly. I also realized that I really liked having a hand in creating digital products.<br /><b>Why am I making a career switch?</b><br />A few years ago I was working with a software company we had contracted with to update the database that we used to match carpoolers. It was then that I realized that I really liked creating a new, groundbreaking product. When I moved to Chicago, I was able to do some professional development to help me make a career switch.</div>
