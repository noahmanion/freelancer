<span class="sectionheader">What about Growth Hacking?</span><br />
	I’m a tinkerer, I really like figuring out how things work and how I can make them work better. In my last job I noticed that there was a high rate of bounce during the user registration process. I was able to brainstorm a solution in order to reduce bounces by 75%. Later, at SIC, I wanted to figure out paid placement. I bought some ads pointing to my groupon referral link and was able ot make some referral dollars while optimizing the ads. But if there’s someone here from Groupon, lets try to keep this story away from risk management?<br />
	I’m always hungry to learn more and improve my skills. I’m always wanting to get better. I think I can live somwehre between dev, marketing and product. I can speak geek and speak English. Let me finish off with a joke. I’d be happiest at an early or mid stage company, but ultimately I’m interested in a place where I can make a difference. I really want to be able to point to something and say, “Hey, I did that.”<br />

	A few years ago I was working with a software company we had contracted with to update the database that we used to match carpoolers. It was then that I realized that I really liked creating a new, groundbreaking product. When I moved to Chicago, I was able to do some professional development to help me make a career switch.<br />

	I'm intersted in big data and finding ways to drive growth theough the use of analytics. I'm working on learning the skills that would be helpful as a Growth Hacker or a Marketing Data Scientist.
